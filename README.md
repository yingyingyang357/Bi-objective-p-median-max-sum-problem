# Bi-objective-p-median-max-sum-problem

This repo contains an exact Method for the Bi-objective p-median Max-sum Diversity
Problem (Bp-MMSDP) [1]. Our repo contains four major algorithms

- An improved bi-section search algorithm to solve max-min diversity problem.
- $\epsilon$-constraint method for solving Bp-MMSDP.
- Tangent cutting plane method for solving each p-median problem with diversity constraint.
- Benders decomposition method for solving each p-median problem with diversity constraint.
